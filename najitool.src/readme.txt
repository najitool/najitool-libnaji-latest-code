Support najitool: if you want to support najitool, you can do so by testing
it and reporting any bugs you may find (and if possible sending fixes), by
sending the author source code of new functions, by translating the homepage
and documentation to your language, by telling people about najitool, by
hosting it on your website or FTP server, by donating money (even small
amounts like $1 are appreciated and keeps najitool alive).

You can donate at http://najitool.sf.net/

Donations are important because they are needed to buy new hardware for CPU
and data storage intensive functions of najitool. There is a function called
allfiles in najitool which generates every possible file ever possible to
exist at the specified size. Unfortunately, even specifying small numbers
can even generate too many files to store on todays technology's hardware.
The allfiles function is a great idea, and it is hoped that people would
notice it and invest in it, please contact the author if you wish to
develope hardware around that idea and other ideas around it.
